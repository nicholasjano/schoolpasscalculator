# schoolpasscalculator
In this program, I use Python's Object-Oriented Programming to set up 3 students, amd check if they passed their grade. A completed exam and a mark above 65 will be a pass.

This program utilizes Classes to easily set up and check the students, and type hints to make the code easier to understand and navigate.
